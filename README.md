##Contrastive Learning##

This example demonstrates how to implement a Contrastive Learning Siamese Network using Contrastive Loss to determine whether a pair of images are similar. Contrastive Loss was introduced by Yann Le Cunn et al. in the paper "Dimensionality Reduction by Learning an Invariant Mapping.".
It helps to convert image into embedding
